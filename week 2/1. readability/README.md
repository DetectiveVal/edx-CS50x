This program assigns a grade to a piece of text using the Coleman-Liau index. This was a very interesting program to write since I had never heard of algorithms to figure out a person's reading level. This is also another example of something that I can now add to my general knowledge.

Usage:

./readability

Once prompted, write the piece of text that you want to be graded.
