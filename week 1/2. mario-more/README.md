Ok, I'll admit, this one was a bit challenging at first. I couldn't figure out how to add the initial spaces separating the pyramids, eventually however after testing many different prints I came to a solution.

Usage:

./mario

When prompted to enter the height enter a number between 1 and 8 inclusive.
