This was a very interesting program to write as it taught me a little about the process of investigating a crime scene. For this program we have to analyze a DNA sequence and say who it belongs to based on a csv database.


Usage:

python dna.py [database] [sequence]

Where database is the file containing people's DNA sequence and sequence is the sequence you want to find the owner of.
