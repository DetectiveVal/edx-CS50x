This is it. This was the task I was told to fear before enlisting onto CS50. From youtube videos to forum posts about the difficulty spike that this program brought. Although similar to plurality this voting simulator uses the Tideman voting method. The most difficult part was to use 2D arrays in order to draw a graph that decides who the winner is. 


Usage:

./tideman [up to 9 candidate names separated by a space]

Once prompted enter the ammount of voters and the order in which each voter preffers their candidate.
