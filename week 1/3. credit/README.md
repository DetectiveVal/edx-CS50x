This program will let the user know if the card is valid and whether it is a American Expres, MasterCard or Visa card using Luhn's algorithm. This was very fun to code and I was able to add Luhn's algorithm to my general knowledge.


Usage:

./credit


Once prompted, enter the credit card number without any extra characters such as spaces or hyphens.
