This was a little fun program where we had to find out who stole the CS50 duck using a few databases handed to us by the city. It was enjoyable and really helped memorize some of the SQL commands.

Usage:

Run sqlite3 on the fiftyville.db

Run the commands written in log.sql to see the steps I took to find the thief.

Open the answers.txt to see the conclusion I arrived at.
