//I AM SLOWLY ADDING THE READMES SO HOLD ON//


This is all the code that I wrote when I was doing Harvard's CS50x. 

I really enjoyed this course and would recommend it to anyone who wants to get into computer science or for anyone having a hard time grasping the basic concepts of computing.

The code is writte in C, Python, SQL, HTML and CSS as per the requirement of the indivual tasks. Included with each code will be a description of each task.
