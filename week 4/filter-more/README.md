This was a very fun program to write. Its purpose is to take a BMP image and apply a filter over it by manipulating each pixel's RGB values. Its one of the programs we make where we can see its real world applications and its effects first hand. 

The available filters are:

Greyscale (-g)= Black and white.

Reflect (-r)= Reflects an image horizontally.

Blur (-b)= Makes an image blurry.

Edgers (-e)= Highlights the edges of the objects in an image.

Usage:

./filter [-filter] [input file name] [output file name]
