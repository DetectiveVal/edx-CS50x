This program was one that I was looking forward to. I have always had some sort of fascination towards encryption and although this is not a full on encryption method it was still fun to have some sort of insight into it. This was also the first time we started to use ARGV as an input method.

Usage:

./substitution [key]

The key must be 26 characters long and must only consist of letters from the alphabet.

Once prompted, enter the text you wish to encrypt based on the key.
